I will be making a model based on what fanart for a youtuber. 
The art tends to have a trend where it is mostly made up of different variations of a sword in the stone style art with different things on or nearby it. I plan on making a version of it in the snow with different items around it. 
I'm not sure what I will be putting next to it yet though. 
In the environment I plan on having snow in the air with trees and a simple house.
